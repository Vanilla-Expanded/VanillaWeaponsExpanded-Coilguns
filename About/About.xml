  <description>Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Coilguns is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of spacer-tech weapons, fully craftable upon researching mass drivers technology. Coilguns come with a unique gimmick - whilst their firing speed and aiming time are quite unforgiving, projectiles fires from these weapons pierce any target they hit - flesh or metal, as well as any obstacles. Each obstacle reduces damage dealt to the next unlucky object/creature, but effectively these weapons allow your colonists to score multi-kills with a single shot.

Shots fired by these weapons cannot penetrate mountains or reinforced walls from Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer.

Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.</description>
